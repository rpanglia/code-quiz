# The Coding Quiz

The purpose of this project was to create a time-based quiz with multiple choice questions the use is required to answer. This application is to run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by JavaScript code. 


## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

## Pending Work
This application is also required to have a responsive user interface. This continues to be a work in progress and this README.md will be updated once this feature is complete.
